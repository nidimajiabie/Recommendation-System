# Recommendation-System

Introduction

In this notebook, I will use ResNet50 Model and Convolutional Autoencoder Model to create two kind of Fashion Embeddings. We will use embeddings to identify similar items, this information will be used to recommend similar content in Recommendation System.

1. Data Preparation

2. Use ResNet50 Model to Recommendation

3. Use Convolutional Autoencoder Model to Recommendation

4. Visualization Latent Space of Contents
